Please create an issue before working on a pull request. It's helpful for you to know if the idea you have in mind will for sure be incorporated into the project, and won't require you to acquaint yourself with the project internals. It even opens the floor for someone else to do the work implementing it for you.

Some [existing issues are labeled straightforward](https://gitea.katniss.top/jacob/smart-home-in-rust-with-home-assistant/issues?labels=42) and expected to be the easiest to work on, if you'd like to try.

Any pull request you make to this repository must 
1. contain exclusively commits that are [cryptographically verified](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) to have been authored by you.
2. be explicitly dedicated to the public domain. You can do this by retaining the copywright waiver in [the pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE).

Your contribution will be declined if it does not ensure this project remains completely free and unencumbered by anyone's copyright monopoly.
